transport layer control:

<<< Changing read/write buffer sizes >>>
sudo sysctl -w net.core.rmem_max=<new value>
sudo sysctl -w net.core.wmem_max=<new value>

<< Setting for allowing thread priority of the UHD >>
Non-privileged users need special permission to change the scheduling priority. Add the following line to the file /etc/security/limits.conf:

@GROUP    - rtprio    99

Replace GROUP with a group in which your user is a member. You may need to log out and log back into the account for the settings to take effect. In most Linux distributions, a list of groups and group members can be found in the file /etc/group.
